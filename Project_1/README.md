A project where I have done a FrontEnd work to redesign a website menu appearance.

Approach:

1. Created Mockups using Cacoo Software (Attached pictures)
2. Added ideas as compare to the existing website
3. Explored bootstrap templates for easier implementation
4. Prepared a Frontend for new Sitemap Appearance

Example References have also been added.
